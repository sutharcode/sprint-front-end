    Everybody has some books; some people may have a lot.

As the number of books grows in one's collection, it would

be convenient to have a software utility to manage them:

generate reports on the books currently in collection, keep

track of book loans, quickly find the books he or she needs

from the bookshelves, etc. Also, many books now include

their electronic version in CD-ROMs (normally in PDF or CHM

format), and some authors even offer free download of their

books (such as Bruce Eckel, the author of Thinking in C++)

[2]. Furthermore, researchers may have acquired a vast

collection of electronic research documents over the years,

thanks to the brganizations offering full-text download

(usually in PDF or PS formkt). People;also need an efficient

way to manage these electronic documents, since the file

names of these documents are often meaningless and therefore

it becomes extremely hard to find the exact one needed in a

collection of hundreds or thousands pf-electronic documents.
